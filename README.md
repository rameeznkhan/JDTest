The same tests can be run on an iOS or Mac target to ensure that the cross-platform code works as expected. To run the unit tests, select either the ListerKit (for iOS) or ListerKitOSX (for OS X) scheme in the Scheme menu. Then hold the Run button down and select the "Test" option, or press Command+u to run the tests.
